Problem:
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.



Example:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.





Solution:

int findComplement( int num ) {
	int mask = 0, tmp=num;
	while( tmp ) {
		tmp = tmp >> 1;
		mask = mask << 1;
		mask = mask | 1;
	}
	return ~num & mask;
}
